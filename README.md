## ‚òëÔ∏è Compliances
### Contrast Checker 7+
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, better known as WCAG, for color contrast and text.
People who are color blind and have impaired vision can experience sensitivity and often physical pain to certain colors and shades of light.

### Material-design compliant
A software that is "material design compliant" follows the guidelines set forth in Google's Material Design system, which provides a visual language and interaction design guidelines for creating consistent and user-friendly interfaces across different devices and platforms. Material Design defines the look, feel, and behavior of on-screen elements such as buttons, icons, text fields, and navigation elements. Adherence to these guidelines helps ensure that the software provides a visually appealing, consistent, and intuitive user experience.

## üöÄ Features
### Internationalization with i18n
We want the documentation to be available in any language so that it can reach **everyone**.

Currently available in 2 languages: English (en) and Portuguese (pt).

### Menu search engine based in keywords and i18n (Beta)
The search for content in the documentation is simple, fast and easy.
The search input text in the **menu** makes it easy to **search** for any content (headers, texts, source codes, ...) **using keywords** and you can do it in your favorite language.
If the defined language is not English and if the search term is not found or has not been set in current language, by default a search is still performed using keywords in English.

### Source code highlighted (Beta)
This documentation generates codes with Syntax highlighting from texts with multiline and line indented stored in i18n files. So you can access the codes of the documentation **offline** and we can also use i18n for example to translate code comments.

### Navigation using anchored links (RC)
Anchor links work in hash and history mode and provide **faster navigation** and **better orientation** when navigating through subsections of documentation.

### Support to dark mode (Beta)
Dark mode, also known as night mode or dark theme. In dark mode, the background of the interface is usually black or dark gray, while the text and icons are displayed in white or light colors.
The purpose of dark mode is to reduce eye strain and improve visual ergonomics, especially in low-light conditions. The high contrast between the dark background and light text makes it easier to read and navigate, while also reducing the amount of blue light emitted by the screen, which can disrupt sleep patterns.
