# Command-Line Interface (CLI)

In the universe of programming, the `Command-Line Interface (CLI)` is an indispensable tool, allowing direct interaction with a computer through text commands in a terminal. In the realm of software development, an efficient CLI can be the difference between a smooth and a complicated user experience.

## Introduction to CLI

The CLI is a text-based interface where users interact with a program through manually typed commands. It's a powerful and efficient way to control and automate tasks, especially in the realms of development and system administration.

## Bootgly CLI

In the context of the Bootgly Framework, we are focused on simplifying and optimizing the development of command-line interfaces. Our mission is to provide robust and flexible components that allow developers to create intuitive and powerful CLIs for their applications.

### Command Parser

The Bootgly Command Parser allows the parsing and interpreting of arguments passed through the command line, making it easy to extract relevant information and take appropriate actions based on them.

### Options and Arguments Manager

With the Options Manager, developers can define and manage the available options for their commands, including short and long command-line options, default values, constraints, and automatic documentation.

### Intuitive User Interface

The Bootgly CLI's user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear prompts and informative error messages to guide users through their interactions.

### Modern Visual (UI) Components

Our framework supports a wide variety of visual components to enhance the user experience, such as `Alert`, `Fieldset`, `Menu`, `Progress`, `Table`, etc.
