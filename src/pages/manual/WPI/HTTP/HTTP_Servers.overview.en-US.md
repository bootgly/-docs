# HTTP Servers

The HTTP server Code API in Bootgly is designed to provide integration and interoperability with HTTP servers featuring multiple Server Application Programming Interfaces (SAPIs). With Bootgly, developers can effortlessly develop for the Web using a wide variety of servers. This flexibility ensures that applications developed with Bootgly can run efficiently in various HTTP server configurations and environments without requiring extensive modifications and ensuring the constant evolution of your project.

## Multi-Server and Multi-SAPI Support

One of the key features of Bootgly is its support for multiple HTTP servers and SAPIs. This means you can run your application on any HTTP server, regardless of the type of SAPI it employs. In addition to traditional servers like "Apache", "Nginx", and "LiteSpeed", you can develop for the Web on Bootgly's built-in CLI HTTP server using the same Code API.

## Unified Code API

A major differentiator of Bootgly is the uniformity of the Request and Response Code API, regardless of the HTTP server or SAPI in use. This means that the HTTP request and response programming logic remains consistent even when switching between HTTP servers with different SAPIs, such as "Apache", "Nginx", "LiteSpeed", Bootgly HTTP Server CLI, etc.

This approach provides developers with a high level of abstraction and ease of understanding, simplifying the process of developing and maintaining web applications in heterogeneous environments.

## Benefits of the Interoperable Approach

- **Wide Compatibility**: Ability to run web applications on any HTTP server with any supported SAPI.
- **Development Consistency**: The unified Code API simplifies code development and maintenance in different environments.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Ready to add support for new SAPIs in the future, ensuring continuous scalability and adaptability.

## Future Expandability

Bootgly is constantly evolving, and new support for different SAPIs will be added in the future. This means you will have access to an even wider ecosystem of HTTP servers, ensuring the flexibility needed to meet the specific demands of your applications.
