# Estrutura de diret√≥rios

The Bootgly PHP Framework has been very organized since its inception and offers a solid structure for building your code.

A fundamental part of this structure is the arrangement of directories in its root folder, which has been carefully designed to ensure clear and efficient organization in increasing order of dependencies. One of the reasons for this pattern is to separate everything that belongs to the Framework itself from everything that was produced through it.

## Global folder @

The `@/` folder is a global folder for artifacts and metadata. It can be found in Bootgly directories.

It is a location intended to store relevant information about the project, such as configuration files, metadata files, and other general files specific to the local context where this folder is located.

As a global folder, you can create it in your projects produced with Bootgly.
