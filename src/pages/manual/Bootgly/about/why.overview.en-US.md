# Why Bootgly?

The key point of Bootgly is integration as a base for efficiency, performance and versatility, generating as a consequence APIs for easy understanding.

## Minimum dependency

It is normal when creating a new package to take advantage of the existence of other third-party packages to speed up development in the short term, but as everything in engineering, there are always advantages and disadvantages in it.

We understand that a Framework is something base, and as such, there should not be many third-party packages in your composition because the greater the external dependency, the less integrated and fragile the project as a whole can be, generating some problems:

1. Notifications and bug fixes and vulnerabilities of third-party packages can decrease the reaction time of patch releases;
2. In the medium or long term, external dependencies can delay the implementation of new features and improvements due to limitations that may exist in the API of the third party package;
3. The dependency on third party packages increases the learning curve for beginners and for potential source code contributors because it forces learning of external projects with different authors and coding styles.

Bootgly has this policy of **minimum dependency** to third party packages, allowing more secure development, with the maximum integration between internal components, favoring the rapid implementation of new features and improvements, and making the code base easy to understand.

With this view, many Bootgly features are built-in and are fully integrated with the Framework itself, thus allowing complete integration with the possibility of rapid extension of its capabilities.

The big downside to this approach is that launches become more time-consuming.
